<span style="font-family: monospace;">Security Manual for eyeOS &gt;= 0.8.5</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">----------------------------------</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The security of web applications is a complex issue depending, as it does, on a number of components, the principal ones being :</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; -The underlying operating system</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; -The web server software</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; -The PHP installation</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; -The eyeOS code</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">A vulnerability in any one
component can leave all other components open to abuse. Not all
components are under control of the user who must then work within the
configuration as defined. There are numerous texts available on how to
secure web servers and PHP installations and we encourage you to refer
to those which cover your particular installations. This document
addresses primarily the issues relating directly to the eyeOS code.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The required level of security
depends upon the use being made of the system. An eyeOS system used as
a private PIM for a single user on a single machine does not
necessarily need a sophisticated security analysis. On the other hand,
careful consideration must be given to an eyeOS installation on a
public server and providing service to a wide range of users. Further
security measures may be required depending on the sensitivity of the
information being kept in the eyeOS system. Obviously special care must
be taken to ensure that any private data is protected to the greatest
extent possible.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Security and convenience are
often in conflict.&nbsp; An appropriatest compromise must be set. That
compromise depends on the various factors described in this paper.
Establishing a public open access eyeOS system should not be undertaken
lightly. Multiple security aspects must be understood and decisions
made as to acceptable risks and necessary security.&nbsp; The eyeOS
team have chosen to make the default configuration as open and free as
possible, it is up the the installation manager to implement all
security features the consider appropriate and necessary for their
system.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">eyeOS is a very flexible system
providing a wide range of possible services. Some of these are not
compatible with the operation of a fully secure system. For example, a
default eyeOS system provides facilities to allow any user to upload
new applications which could, potentially, become security risks. </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The eyeOS team can make no
guarantees on the security of any eyeOS installation, we will, however,
strive to ensure that the eyeOS PHP code is as secure as possible
and&nbsp; provide security options wherever possible.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The rest of this document lists a
number of features of eyeOS which help provide a more or less secure
system.&nbsp; Some of these will require more or less limited access to
the server file system and knowledge of basic system administration
terms and techniques.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">General file and directory permissions</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">--------------------------------------</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The server file system may
provide some level of protection from abuse by non authorized
users.&nbsp; The eyeOS system requires write access to certain
directories and files, on some systems that access may need to be
provide outside the eyeOS system. </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Other than the etc/, usr/ and
etc/ directories (and the usr_apps/ directory if enabled) eyeOS does
not require write access to the other files and directories which may
be write disabled for an additional level of security. Note, however,
that those files and directories will need to be write re-enabled in
order to perform system updates.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">File browsing protection</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">------------------------</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The entire eyeOS files system for
all users is by necessity a part of the web accessible file system.
This means that a user may gain access to any file by the fact of
knowing its name and location and typing in that URL.&nbsp; Most eyeOS
configuration information is stored in .xml format which is readily
browsable. In order to hide the configuration data, which may include
encrypted passwords, you can change various system parameters in the
installation advanced security parameters. A suitable change would be
to change all .xml files to .php which cannot be browsed from a simple
URL. </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">In general it is impossible to
guarantee that one eyeOS user file cannot be accessed from another user
name, all files being stored within the same web space.&nbsp; However,
if the names of the /usr and /home directories are changed in the
advanced parameters, a malicious user will be ignorant of the actual
names used.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">For added security in multi-user, public systems it is also recommended that the name of the root user be changed.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">It is possible to restrict users
from accessing any files and directories other that those specifically
granted. This is done using the web browser security facilities. This
would add another layer to the security system making it more secure at
the cost of an inconvenient second login.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Application Loading</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">-------------------</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The default eyeOS configuration
allows any user to upload into the eyeOS space applications of the
appropriate format. This is clearly a potential security vulnerability.
It is relatively easy to write an eyeOS application which will allow a
user to browse the file system. An option in the sysdefs.php file
allows two levels of restriction on application loading. The first is
to limit application uploading to only the root user, the second
disables all application uploads. Added security can be provided by
removing the eyeApps.eyeapp application in the /apps directory if its
other features are not necessary.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The root user may limit any
particular user as to the applications they are allowed to run by
editing the usrinfo.xml file in that users /usr directory. The apps
element is a comma separated list of applications which will appear on
the users desktop icon bar.&nbsp; If the eyeApps.eyeapp&nbsp; app is
not listed than that user will be unable to change that list of apps.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Passwords</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">---------</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Though not specific to eyeOS the
question of password is fundamental to good security. Use long rather
than short ones, mix upper and lower case with one or more numeric and
punctuation characters.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Sysdefs.php</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">-----------</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">The sysdefs.php file is used to
specify certain core system parameters. It is automatically loaded
whenever and eyeOS request is made. Certain values can be changed in
this file BEFORE eyeOS installation by the use of the installation
advanced security parameters panel. Note that if any changes are made
to these parameters, special care will be needed when upgrading the
eyeOS base system.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
