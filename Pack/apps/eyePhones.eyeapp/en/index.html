<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>eyePhones is your personal phone, address, and e-mail directory. Not only does it record the standard contact information other personal contact lists have, but you can also record on-line information (like URLs, instant messenger IDs, VoIP accounts, etc.). <br>
When you launch eyePhones, you will be presented with a list of your current stored records in table format. The columns of the table are as follows: <br>
<strong>Name:</strong> Displayed as Family name first, then given name <br>
<strong>Home Phone Number:</strong> Format specified by you <br>
<strong>View:</strong> Click this icon to view the details of the record <br>
<strong>Edit:</strong> Click this icon to edit the contents of the record <br>
<strong>Delete:</strong> Click this icon to delete the record from your directory </p>

<h2>Adding &amp; Editing Records</h2>
<p>To add new records to your directory, click on <strong>New contact</strong>, found at the top of the eyePhone's main directory window. <br>
To edit existing records, click on the <strong>Edit</strong> icon next to the record you wish to update. <br>
Both of these functions will take to you the same editing window. The difference being, a new contact entry screen will be blank. <br>
The data entry has fields for personal information, business information and web related information. At the very bottom of the entry screen, there is a box for general comments. <br>
When you've updated the fields with the data you wish to record for this person, simply click on the diskette or <strong>Save</strong> icon located at the top right corner of the data entry window <em>AND</em> at the bottom of the window. <br>
When you click the save icon, you will be taken back to the main directory view. <br>
You can also get to the data entry screen via the <strong>View</strong> option by clicking on the <strong>Edit</strong> icon, found at the top right corner of the window.</p>
