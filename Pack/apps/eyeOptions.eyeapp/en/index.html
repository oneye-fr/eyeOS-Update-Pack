<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>eyeOptions is where you can configure your eyeOS desktop and account preferences, like the desktop theme, wallpaper and password for your account. <br>
The Root (or System Administrator) also has the ability to change the Host (or Server) name and add or remove user accounts.</p>

<a name="part2">
<h2>Customizing Your Desktop</h2>
<p>Within the <strong>Look and feel</strong> portion of eyeOptions, you can change your desktop environment in two ways: you can simply change the wallpaper image on your desktop, or you can change the "theme." A theme includes the choice of wallpaper, style of icons for the core system apps, and where the Application Dock appears. <br>
To change the wallpaper, click on the <strong>Browse</strong> button found next to the entry field labelled <strong>New wallpaper:</strong> Within the pop-up dialog box that appears, navigate to where the desired image is stored on your PC's hard drive. Then, click the button labelled <strong>Change wallpaper</strong> within your eyeOptions window. <br>
If you wish to return to the defaul wallpaper (for the theme you have chosen), click on the <strong>Restore eyeOS wallpaper</strong> button. <br>
If you'd like to change the theme of your desktop, scroll down the eyeOptions window and click on the bullet selector next to one of the themes that are listed (as thumbnail screenshots) under the <strong>Change theme</strong> heading. Once you've chosen the theme you wish to work with, scroll down further and click on the <strong>Change theme</strong> button. <br>
Your desktop theme will now be altered to reflect your changes</p>

<h2>Changing Your Password</h2>
<p>In your eyeOption window, scroll down to the portion labelled <strong>System options</strong>. Here you will find the place to change your user password. <br>
Simply enter your existing password and then your new password (entered twice to ensure accuracy). When you've filled in the entry fields, click the <strong>Change password</strong> button to update your account.</p>

<h2>Root / System Admin Tools</h2>
<p>As root (or super user), you have some extra tools under eyeOption's <strong>System options</strong> heading. These tools are as follows: <br>
<strong>Change password</strong>: From the drop down menu, select the user account you wish to change the password for and fill in the fields as described above. <br>
<strong>New host name</strong>: This is the name of your eyeOS system, which appears on the log-in screen. You can update this name here by entering a new name and then clicking on the <strong>Change hostname</strong> button. <br>
<strong>New user</strong>: This is where you add new user accounts to your eyeOS system. Enter a user name, a password for the acccount (entered twice), and a "real name" for the user. Click on the <strong>Create user</strong> button to create the new account. <br>
<strong>Delete user</strong>: You can delete user accounts here, by entering your root password, then from the drop down menu, select the user account you wish to delete. Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button to permanently remove the account from the system. <br>
<em>Caution</em>: any personal data stored in the user's home directory will be deleted as well.</p>
