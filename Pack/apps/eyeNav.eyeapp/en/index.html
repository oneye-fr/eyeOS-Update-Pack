<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>eyeNav is your web browser for the eyeOS system. At the present time, much of the functionality of eyeNav depends greatly on the web browser that you are using to access your eyeOS network. <br>
For example, if you wish to view multimedia web pages that contain Macromedia Flash files, or Quicktime AVIs, you must have these plug-ins installed on the PC you're currently logged in with.</p>

<a name="part2">
<h2>Browsing the Internet</h2>
<p>Browsing the Internet is straight forward. Once you launch eyeNav, type the URL of the web site you wish to visit in the URL entry box, found at the top left corner of the window (next to the <strong>Go</strong> button). Press <em>Enter</em> on your keyboard or click the <strong>Go</strong> button to navigate to the site you've specified. <br>
You may notice that eyeNav does not have Back, Forward, or Refresh buttons (at present time). You can use the functionality of your PC's installed web browser by right-mouse clicking in the web page window to access it's built-in navigation functions.</p>

<h2>Keyword Searches and Saving Bookmarks</h2>
<p>eyeNav has the capability of performing keyword searches via four supported search engines; Google, a9, Ask, and Yahoo! <br>
To perform a search, simply type in the keyword(s) you wish to search for in the URL box (to the left of the <strong>Go</strong> button), then choose the search engine by clicking on the drop down menu box (Google is the default), and finally click the <strong>Search</strong> button to execute. eyeNav will display the results of your search in the main browser window. <br>
To save a web site in your bookmarks directory (the pane along the right-hand side of the eyeNav window), navigate to the web page as described above. Once you've reached the web page you wish to bookmark, in the entry box labelled <strong>Bookmark:</strong>, enter a brief description for the web page, then click the <strong>Save</strong> button. <br>
Within the bookmark directory, you will now see a link with the title you've specified. Click on the link to go to the website. You will also see a small <strong>X</strong> next to the link. Click this if you wish to delete the bookmark at any time. <br>
<em>Note: In order to properly save bookmarks, you must navigate to the web page of your choice directly - that is, by entering the web address in the URL entry box and clicking Go. Bookmarks are saved at your "point of entry", for lack of a better term.</em></p>
