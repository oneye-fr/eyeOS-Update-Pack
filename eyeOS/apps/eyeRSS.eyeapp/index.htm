<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>eyeRSS provides a simple RSS feed viewer.</p> 
<p>When you launch the eyeRSS application, the last RSS feed that you viewed will
be loaded. The very first time you use eyeRSS, you will need to set the URL
of an RSS feed into the feed text area at the top of the right panel, then click
the 'Add Feed' button.</p>
<p>The panel on the right shows the various feeds that you have bookmarked for
viewing. To select a feed for viewing simply click its name in the list. To 
delete a feed from the list click on the corresponding delete icon. New feeds 
can be added to the list by entering their URL into the text box at the top of
the panel and clicking on the 'Add Feed' button. The new feed data will appear 
in the panel on the left and its name will be appended to the list in the right
panel.
<p>The panel on the left shows the feed data. The title of the feed currently
being displaye dis shown in the action bar. Feed items are displayed, 
separated by horizontal rules and in the order that they appear in the feed.
The feed item title is displayed in large font and clicking on it will start
eyeNav displaying the web page to which the feed item refers. A feed item may
also specify a time stamp which is displayed below and to the right of the 
title. An item description is displayed below the title and above any timestamp.
<p>If the user option to display only titles is set, then descriptions are not
displayed but items with a descripton will have a small "expand" icon on the 
right. Clicking that icon will scroll the item data list until the one 
corresponding to the icon clicked is at the top of the panel. The description 
for that, and only that item will be displayed. Opening a different description
display will close the one curently open.</p>

<h2><b>User configuration Options</b></h2>
<p>Clicking on the user configuration icon on the window bar causes the user 
configuration panel to appear. This provideds a number of options which may be 
modified by the user. 
The values of these options are saved on a per user basis.</p>
<p>Changing any of these configuration options will cause the current feed to
be reloaded and redisplayed using the newly set values.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><a name='article-count'></a>Articles to show</b></dt>
<dd>This option limits the number of articles displayed from a data feed to
the value specified. If a value of zero is set then all feed items will be 
displayed.</dd> 

<dt><b><a name='headlines-only'></a>Headlines Only</b></dt>
<dd>When active, this option will display items without their descripion fields,
which can sometimes be long. Any one item description can be displayed by 
clicking on the corresponding expand icon to the right of the entry. If no expand
icon appears then the item has no description.</dd>

<dt><b><a name='clock-display'></a>Clock display format</b></dt>
<dd>A string specifying the format of the clock displayed at the right of the
tool bar. The string should contain format controls which are the '%' character
followed by a recognised control character from the table below. These format
controls are replaced by the corresponding values:
<table align='center'>

  <tr><td align='right'> %A </td><td></td><td>'AM' or 'PM'</td></tr>
  <tr><td align='right'> %g </td><td></td><td>Hours as value 1 to 12</td></tr>
  <tr><td align='right'> %G </td><td></td><td>Hours as value 0 to 23</td></tr>
  <tr><td align='right'> %h </td><td></td><td>Hours as value 01 to 12</td></tr>
  <tr><td align='right'> %H </td><td></td><td>Hours as value 00 to 23</td></tr>
  <tr><td align='right'> %i </td><td></td><td>Minutes as value 00 to 59</td></tr>
  <tr><td align='right'> %s </td><td></td><td>Seconds as value 00 to 59</td></tr>
