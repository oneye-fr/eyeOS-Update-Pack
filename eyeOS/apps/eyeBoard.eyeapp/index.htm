<p>eyeBoard is a tag board program. Each user can add new text, and superuser can empty the
whole log. A header shows the time and name of the user who posted each message.</p> 

<p>At the user's option, the time of last viewing can be saved and the
application can be invoked at login time to show the bulletin board only
if it has ben updated since the last viewing.</p>

<p>To have eyeBoard check for updates at each logon and only show the board if it has
changed since the last time you displayed it use the app manager to autorun eyeBoard with
an argument of '(check)'. Now at logon time, eyeBoard will run and check if the board has been changed since
the last time it recorded you displaying it. If no changes have been made, 
eyeBoard will terminate. If the board has been updated it will be displayed as normal.</p>
