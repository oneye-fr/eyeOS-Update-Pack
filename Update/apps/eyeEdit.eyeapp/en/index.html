<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>eyeEdit is the text editor application for the eyeOS system.<br>
When you launch the application, you will be presented with a blank document.<br>
Across the top of the window, you'll see the app's "Main Menu". The options are as follows:<br>
<strong>New Document:</strong> Click to re-launch eyeEdit with a blank document.<br>
<strong>Open Document:</strong> Open an existing document from either from your list of "Private" or the system's list of "Public" documents.<br>
<strong>Save Document:</strong> Save the current document under the file name specified in the "Title" block.<br>
<strong>Copy to Home as HTML file:</strong> When the "Save Document" icon is selected, save a copy of it in your Home folder in HTML format (more on this option later).<br>
<strong>Status</strong> option: When the "Save Document" icon is selected, save the document as either a private file (only accessible by you) or as a Public file (accessible by all users).<br>
Below the "Main Menu" is the <strong>Title</strong> Block in which you specify the name that the document will be saved as.<br>
Below the Title Block is the main document area, in which you type the contents of the file, along with several formatting tools. </p>

<h2>Creating / Formatting Your Document</h2>
<p>eyeEdit follows the same layout, and has many of the same tools, as most of today's word processors provide.<br>
Using your mouse, highlight text ranges and choose from many of the formatting tools you'll find in the formatting toolbar. eyeEdit offers you the following formatting tools (from left to right) Font-Face, Font-Size, Bold, Italics, Underline, Left Justify, Center Justify, Right Justify, Line Numbering, Line Bulleting, Indent, Outdent, Undo, Redo, Font Colour, Highlight, Underline, URL Link Insert, Image Insert, and Table Insert.<br>
When formatting text font colour and highlight colour, you will be presented with a colour chart. Choose the colour you wish to use for the selected text from the table by clicking on it. </p>

<h2>Inserting an Image</h2>
<p>To insert a picture into your document, position the cursor to where you would like image to appear. Click on the <strong>Image</strong> icon from the formatting toolbar.<br>
You will now be required to enter some information that will determine how the image will appear in your document.<br>
You can insert relatively any image found on the Internet into your document. All you need is the URL (or the Internet address) of the image, which looks something like this:<br><pre>http://www.webpageaddress.com/name-of-image.jpg.</pre><br>
If you would like to include an image from your eyeOS home directory, simply enter the URL http:home/your-login-id/name-of-image.jpg.<br>
Next, you can give your image an alternate description by typing said name in the <strong>Text</strong> box.<br>
Choose the alignment of the image, be it left, or right, or normal (otherwise known as in-line).<br>
You can also specify a frame size and colour that you can put around the image. To do this, in the <strong>Border</strong> setting, specify the size of the frame in pixels, then colour name, like this: <strong>5px blue outset</strong>.<br>
Finally, you can set a margin (how much whitespace there is left around the image) by putting a number in the box labelled <strong>Margin</strong>. Click Insert Image button to complete the procedure.

<h2>Using Tables</h2>
<p>To insert a table into your document, position the cursor to where you would like the table to appear. Click on the <strong>Table</strong> icon from the formatting toolbar.<br>
You will now be required to enter some information that will determine how the table will appear in your document.<br>
In the <strong>Rows</strong> field, enter the number of rows you'd like to have in your table. If you would like the columns in your table to have bolded titles, change the <strong>No header</strong> row option to <strong>Include header row</strong> by clicking on the drop-down arrow. In the <strong>Column</strong> field, indicate how many columns you'd like to have in your table. And, finally, in the <strong>Border</strong> field, indicate how wide of a border you'd like your table to have (this value is in pixels). Use zero if you don't want to have any border to appear. Now, click on the <strong>Insert table</strong> button to have eyeEdit create the table.<br>
Your new table will have some "place-holder" data within it's cells. To replace the contents, simply click within the cell you wish to update. As you type, the row and column sizes will automatically adjust to accomodate the text you enter.<br>
You can format the text within you template in all of the ways available to you within eyeEdit. You can also insert images within your table, as well as imbedded tables (a table within a cell of a table).<br>
When you are editing text, you can also resize your table and insert or delete additional columns and rows. To resize your table, click and drag on any of the tag boxes, which appear on the corners and borders of the table. To insert a row or column, click on the small left/right or up/down arrows that appear either above or beside the cell you are currently editing. To delete the row or column you are currently editing, click on either of the small circle with an X that appear in between the insert arrows (click the X above the cell to delete the column, click the X beside the cell to delete the row).<br>
Tables are very useful tools and can be used in may ways. Take some time and experiment with them.

<h2>Save &amp; Print Options</h2>
<p>When you're ready to save your document in eyeEdit, make sure that you have a file name within the box labelled <strong>Title</strong>. If you forget, eyeEdit will calcualte a number as the file name, so at least you won't lose the file. Click the <strong>Diskette</strong> (or <strong>Save</strong>) icon located at the top-left corner of the eyeEdit window.<br>
Depending on how you flagged the document (as Private or Public), eyeEdit will save it in either your Private listing or the system's Public listing for others to use.<br>
To retrieve your document after saving it, simply click on the <strong>File Folder</strong> icon, located at the top-left corner of the eyeEdit window. Click on the file name to retrieve the document.<br>
If you'd like to print your eyeEdit document, save it as an HTML file within your eyeHome directory by clicking on the checkbox labelled <strong>Copy to Home as HTML file</strong>. Then click the save (diskette) icon.<br>
Now, open up your eyeHome folder (the icon in your toolbar that resembles a bull's-eye) and you will see an HTML file that has the name of your eyeEdit document. Click on the eyeViewer's icon (looks like a bull's-eye) to the right of the file name.<br>
After eyeViewer has opened the HTML file, click on the <strong>Printer</strong> icon, found at the bottom-center of the window. Your document will now be sent to your printer.
