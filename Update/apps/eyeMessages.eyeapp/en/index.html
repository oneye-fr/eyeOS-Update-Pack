<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Consider eyeMessages as your eyeOS system e-mail application. It allows you to send messages to other system users, as well as read messages other users have sent to you. <br>
Although it does not allow you to send standard e-mails to people outside of the eyeOS system, there is one major advantange.... <em>No bulk spam E-mails in your in-box!</em> <br>
When you first launch eyeMessages, you will be presented with a current list of messages you have in your "in-box". The list contains the message <strong>Title</strong> (or subject line), who the message is <strong>From</strong>, and <strong>When Sent</strong> to tell you when it was sent to you.</p>

<h2>Retrieving / Managing Your Messages</h2>
<p>To read a message that has been sent to you, simply click on the <strong>Titl</strong>e of the message. eyeMessages will then display the contents of the message. Messages that have not been read will have their Title in bold text. <br>
From here, you send a reply message by clicking on the word <strong>Reply</strong>, located next to the message's title.  This will take you directly to the New Message window.<br>
To go back to the message list, click on the <strong>Folder</strong> (or Show Messages) icon in the upper-left corner of the window. <br>
To delete the message from your in-box, click on the <strong>X</strong> (or delete) icon. This icon appears to the left of the Title in the table view, or in the top left corner of the window when viewing the message contents.</p>

<h2>Sending Messages</h2>
<p>To send a message, click on the <strong>Page</strong> (or New message) icon locate in the top-left corner of the message list window. The new message view will be displayed. <br>
First, choose the system user you wish to send a message to by clicking on the drop-down arrow in the <strong>To:</strong> field. Then, enter a title for the message in the <strong>Subject:</strong> field. <br>
Now, enter the message you wish to send in the blank message block below. <br>
When you're ready to send your message, click on the <strong>Diskette</strong> (or Send message) icon found in the top-left corner of the window. <br>
