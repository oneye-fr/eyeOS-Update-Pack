<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>eyeHome acts as your account's "home base". From here, you can view and manage the files stored in your personal storage space, view and send messages to and from other system users, create new text documents, add to your contacts list, and install new applications (to your personal account). <br>
The eyeHome window is divided into two parts, the <strong>Actions</strong> table and the <strong>Home directory</strong> table.</p>

<a name="part2">
<h2>Action Items</h2>
<p>From your <strong>Actions</strong> table, you have quick access to some of the more frequently used eyeOS apps: <strong>New document</strong> - eyeEdit, <strong>New Message</strong> - eyeMessages, <strong>New Contact</strong> - eyePhones, and <strong>Install Application</strong> - eyeOptions. <br>
Under <strong>Notifications</strong>, eyeHome will indicate new messages in your eyeMessages account by changing "No new Messages" to "New Messages". Click on this to open up your eyeMessages folder.</p>

<h2>Managing Files</h2>
<p>To the right of the <strong>Actions</strong> table, you will be presented with a list of files in your home directory. If you have no files stored under your home directory, eyeHome will simply display <strong>Your home Dir is empty</strong>. <br>
To upload new files to your home directory, specify the name of the file you wish to upload from your PC's hard drive in the <strong>Upload a file</strong> box. Use the <strong>Browse...</strong> button to navigate to the file stored on your hard drive. <br>
Click on the <strong>Upload</strong> button (oval button with the arrow pointing to the right) directly below the file name box to tranfer the file to your eyeOS home directory. <br>
Files that are stored in your home folder will be listed in the following way: <br>
<strong>File icon</strong>: an icon representing the file type. <br>
<strong>File name</strong>: the name of the file (with extension). <br>
<strong>File size</strong>: the size of the file. <br>
<strong>File date</strong>: the date and time the file was uploaded. <br>
<strong>View icon</strong>: if the file is a type that can be viewed by eyeViewer, a view icon (in the form of a bulls-eye) will be shown. Click on it to view the document. eyeViewer can display .html, .txt, .jpg, .png, and .bmp files <br>
<strong>Download icon</strong>: click on this icon to download the file from your home directory to the PC's hard drive. <br>
<strong>Delete icon</strong>: click on this icon to delete the file from your home directory, moving to the <strong>eyeTrash</strong> folder. You can view the contents of eyeTrash by clicking on the Recycle (or Trash) icon, located in the bottom right-hand corner of your eyeOS desktop. <br>
<em>Note</em>: The size of the files that are acceptable for uploading to your eyeOS home directory will be determined by the system settings in the PHP config files. Any files exceeding the set limits will be rejected.</p>
