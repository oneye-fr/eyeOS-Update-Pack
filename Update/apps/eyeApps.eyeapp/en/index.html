<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is your applications manager for the eyeOS system. You can access eyeApps by clicking on the <strong>Application Dock</strong> (or toolbar) icon with the plus sign (+) in it. <br>
The eyeApps window will display all of the applications installed on the system that are available to you. To run any of these applications, simply click on the icon for it. <br>
From this window, you can manage the application settings specifically for your desktop environment, as well as install new applications (if the system's administrator has allowed you access to this feature). </p>

<a name="part2">
<h2>Managing Apps</h2>
<p>Click on <strong>Manage Apps</strong> to bring up the settings table. You will see the table formatted into five columns: <br>
<strong>Name:</strong> displays the apps name and icon <br>
<strong>Icon:</strong> select this icon to appear on your Application Dock (limit of 10) <br>
<strong>Auto:</strong> specify start-up parameters <br>
<strong>Skin:</strong> Apply a theme to the application's window <br>
<strong>Remove:</strong> remove applications you have installed </p>

<h2>Auto Launcher</h2>
<p>In the <strong>Auto</strong> text box, you can specify parameters for the applications at the time that you log-in to your desktop. 
For example, if you'd like eyeOS to check for new messages in eyeMessages when you sign on, type the command <strong>(check)</strong> in the Auto line next to the eyeMessages entry. <br>
If you'd like eyeOS to automatically launch your eyeCalendar app when you sign on, type <strong>()</strong> on the Auto line next to the eyeCalendar entry. <br>
When you're done your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the window and click the <strong>Updated app configuration</strong> button.

<h2>Installing New Apps</h2>
<p>Next to the Manage Apps option, you will see the <strong>Install Apps</strong> option, which you use to install new eyeOS application tar.gz packages to the system. <br>
If you install applications while you're logged in as the Root user, they will be available to all users of the system. If you install applications as a regular user, they will only be available to you. <br>
If you happen to notice in your eyeApps menu two icons for the same application, this is most likely a result of you installing an application that Root has also installed for the entire system. 
Click on <strong>Install Apps</strong>. You will be presented with the <strong>Application Installer</strong> dialogue window. 
To install an application, click on the <strong>Browse</strong> button and navigate to where you have the eyeOS application package .tar.gz file stored. Select it and click the Save or Open button (depending on the OS and web browser you're using). The path and name of the file should then appear in the dialogue box within the Application Installer window. 
Click on the arrow button directly below the dialogue box. This will upload and install the .tar.gz file to the eyeOS system. 
If the application is successfully installed, you'll see the words <strong>Install Complete</strong> appear on the bottom frame of the window. You will also see the new icon in your eyeApps window.
</p>
<p>For those applications that you've installed, you can easily remove them from the system by clicking on the cross icon (X) under the <strong>Remove</strong> column to deleted the app.</p>
