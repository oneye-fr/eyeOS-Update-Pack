<h3><a href="licenses.html#TOCIntro" id="Intro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
Published software should be <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</a>.  To make it free software, you need to release it
under a free software license.  We normally use the <a
href="licenses.html#GPL">GNU General Public License</a> (GNU GPL),
but occasionally we use <a href="licenses.html#LicenseList">other
free software licenses</a>.  We use only licenses that are compatible
with the GNU GPL for GNU software.
</p>

<p>
Documentation for free software should be 
<a href="/philosophy/free-doc.html">free documentation</a>, so that
people can redistribute it and improve it along with the software
it describes.  To make it free documentation, you need to release
it under a free documentation license.  We normally use the
<a href="licenses.html#FDL">GNU Free Documentation License</a> (GNU
FDL), but occasionally we use <a href="licenses.html#LicenseList">
other free documentation licenses</a>.
</p>

<h3><a href="licenses.html#TOCGPL"
     id="GPL">The GNU General Public License</a></h3>

<p>
The GNU General Public License is often called the GNU GPL for short;
it is used by most GNU programs, and by more than half of all free
software packages.
</p>

<p>
The GNU GPL is currently being revised, and we welcome your comments
on the proposed text. Please
visit <a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org">http://gplv3.fsf.org</a> to read
the current draft text and to participate in the process.
</p>

<p>
The GNU Lesser General Public License is used by a few (but not
all) GNU libraries. This license was formerly called the Library
GPL, but we changed the name, because the old name encouraged people
to use this license more often than it really ought to be used.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The GNU Lesser General Public License text in three formats:

<p>
The GNU Free Documentation License is a form of copyleft intended

       id="UnofficialTranslations">Unofficial Translations</a></h3>

<p>
Legally speaking, the original (English) version of the GPL is what
specified the actual distribution terms for GNU programs. But to help
people better understand the licenses, we give permission to publish
translations into other languages provided that
they follow our regulations for unofficial translations.

<h3><a href="licenses.html#TOCVerbatimCopying"
       id="VerbatimCopying">Verbatim Copying and Distribution</a></h3>

<p>
The standard copyright notice for GNU webpages reads:
<em>Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article
are permitted worldwide without royalty in any medium provided
this notice is preserved.</em>  Please note the following
commentary by Eben Moglen:
</p>

<p>
"Our intention in using the phrase `verbatim copying in any medium' is
not to require retention of page headings and footers or other
formatting features.  Retention of weblinks in both hyperlinked and
non-hyperlinked media (as notes or some other form of printed URL in
non-HTML media) is required."

<p> If you are contemplating writing a new license, please contact the
FSF by writing to <a
href="mailto:licensing@fsf.org">&lt;licensing@fsf.org&gt;</a>. The
proliferation of different free software licenses means increased work
for users in understanding the licenses; we may be able to help you
find an existing Free Software license that meets your needs. 
</p>

<p>
If that isn't possible, if you really need a new license, with our
help you can ensure that the license really is a Free Software license
and avoid various practical problems.

<h3><a href="licenses.html#TOCWhatIsCopyleft"
       id="WhatIsCopyleft">What Is Copyleft?</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Copyleft</em> is a general method for making a program free
software and requiring all modified and extended versions of the
program to be free software as well.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the
<a href="/philosophy/categories.html#PublicDomainSoftware">public
domain (18k characters)</a>, uncopyrighted.  This allows people to
share the program and their improvements, if they are so minded.  But
it also allows uncooperative people to convert the program into
<a href="/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware">proprietary
software (18k characters)</a>.  They can make changes, many or few,
and distribute the result as a proprietary product.  People who
receive the program in that modified form do not have the freedom that
the original author gave them; the middleman has stripped it away.
</p>

<p>
In the <a href="/gnu/thegnuproject.html">GNU project</a>, our aim
is to give <em>all</em> users the freedom to redistribute and change
GNU software.  If middlemen could strip off the freedom, we might have
many users, but those users would not have freedom.  So instead of
putting GNU software in the public domain, we ``copyleft'' it.
Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or
without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and
change it.  Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom.
</p>

<p>
Copyleft also provides an
<a href="/philosophy/pragmatic.html">incentive</a>
for other programmers to add to free software.
Important free programs such as the GNU C++ compiler exist
only because of this.
</p>

<p>
Copyleft also helps programmers who want to contribute 
<a href="/software/software.html#HelpWriteSoftware">improvements</a> to
<a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> get permission to
do that.  These programmers often work for companies or universities
that would do almost anything to get more money.  A programmer may
want to contribute her changes to the community, but her employer may
want to turn the changes into a proprietary software product.
</p>

<p>
When we explain to the employer that it is illegal to distribute the
improved version except as free software, the employer usually decides
to release it as free software rather than throw it away.
</p>

<p>
To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then
we add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives
everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's
code <em>or any program derived from it</em> but only if the
distribution terms are unchanged.  Thus, the code and the freedoms
become legally inseparable.
</p>

<p>
Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users'
freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom.  That's why we
reverse the name, changing ``copyright'' into ``copyleft.''
</p>

<p>
Copyleft is a general concept; there are many ways to fill in the
details.  In the GNU Project, the specific distribution terms that we
use are contained in the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser
General Public License and the GNU Free Documentation License.
</p>

<p>
The appropriate license is included in many manuals and in each GNU
source code distribution.
</p>

<p>
The GNU GPL is designed so that you can easily apply it to your own
program if you are the copyright holder.  You don't have to modify the
GNU GPL to do this, just add notices to your program which refer
properly to the GNU GPL. Please note that you must use the
entire text of the GPL, if you use it.  It is an integral whole, and
partial copies are not permitted.  (Likewise for the LGPL and the FDL.)
</p>

<p>
Using the same distribution terms for many different programs makes it
easy to copy code between various different programs.  Since they all
have the same distribution terms, there is no need to think about
whether the terms are compatible.  The Lesser GPL includes a
provision that lets you alter the distribution terms to the ordinary
GPL, so that you can copy code into another program covered by the GPL.
</p>

<h3><a href="licenses.html#TOCOtherWorks"
       id="OtherWorks">Licenses for Other Types of Works</a></h3>

<p>
We believe that published software and documentation should be
<a href="licenses.html#Intro"> free software and free documentation</a>.
We recommend making all sorts of educational and reference works free
also, using free documentation licenses such as the
<a href="licenses.html#FDL">GNU Free Documentation License</a> (GNU FDL).
</p>

<p>
For essays of opinion and scientific papers, we recommend the
simple "verbatim copying only" license that is used for this web page.</p>

<p>
We don't take the position that artistic or entertainment works must
be free, but if you want to make one free, we recommend
the <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lalgb.html">Free Art
License</a>.</p>

<!-- If needed, change the copyright block at the bottom. In general, -->
<!-- all pages on the GNU web server should have the section about    -->
<!-- verbatim copying.  Please do NOT remove this without talking     -->
<!-- with the webmasters first. --> 
<!-- Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the document -->
<!-- and that it is like this "2001, 2002" not this "2001-2002." -->
